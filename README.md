Key Features & Functionalities
Topic-based Question Generation: Users can input a Python topic (such as Loops, Lists, Strings, etc.), and the app will generate a relevant question based on that topic. If no questions are found for the entered topic, the app will display a message indicating that no questions are available for that topic.

Multiple Choice Options: Each generated question comes with a set of 4 multiple-choice options. These options are randomized each time the question is displayed, ensuring variety in user experience.

Real-time Feedback on Answer:

When the user selects an answer and clicks the "Submit" button, the app immediately provides feedback on the selected answer:
Correct Answer: The app will show "Correct! Well done!" in green, signaling that the user selected the right answer.
Incorrect Answer: If the selected answer is incorrect, the app will display "Incorrect. Try again." in red, encouraging the user to attempt the question again.
Code Display: Each question is accompanied by a block of Python code related to the question. This helps users understand the context of the question and provides a clear example.

Reset Functionality: After answering a question, users can generate a new question from a different topic or even try the same topic again for a fresh set of questions.

User-Friendly Interface: The app uses Tkinter to create a simple, intuitive GUI where users can easily interact with the quiz, select answers, and receive feedback in an engaging way.

Random Question Selection: For each topic, the app randomly selects one question from a predefined list. This ensures that users are always presented with a variety of questions, even for the same topic.
